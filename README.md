## Objective

Segmented customers to understand shopping behaviors and identify targeted strategies for increased activity.

## Approach

- Analyzed 70,000+ customer orders and product purchased using Python.
- Applied RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to measure customer value. Adapted item counts as a proxy for spending value.
- Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with K-Means clustering to reduce dimensionality and group customers based on their shopping habits.
- Built Dashboard in Tableau to visualize customer segments, top products and department-level insights.

## Key Insights

- Through clustering, found 7 unique customer spending profiles and developed ideas to retain, re-engage or grow each profile.
- Identified staple categories (produce, dairy) with broad customer reach.
- Uncovered order distribution patterns by day and hour, showing peak shopping times.

 ## Impact
Analyzed customer shopping patterns and delivered insights in the form of guided marketing, retention ideas and inventory reccommendations.
